############### Set optional logfile location ##################
## These setup a logfile if your interested in analyzing the output later
##   The filename to use will be based on the hour that you start the client
##   eg: <LOG_PATH>/130334-01.log
LOG_PATH="./log/"
LOG_DATE=$(date +'%y%m%d-%H')

## uncomment the following line to dump the java logs into a file for review
# WEAVE_LOG="${LOG_PATH}${LOG_DATE}.log"

############### Set java location ##################
## Use this location for the raspberry pi and the preview ARM jdk
JAVA_EXEC=/opt/jdk1.8.0/bin/java

############### Set java heap memory ##################
## If you have a 256MB version B1 raspberry pi, use the following settings
##   You may have to change your gpu_mem setting in /boot/config.txt (I have it set to 16)
MAX_MEMORY=100m
MIN_MEMORY=100m

## If you have a 512MB version raspberry pi, use the following settings
#MAX_MEMORY=256m
#MIN_MEMORY=256m
